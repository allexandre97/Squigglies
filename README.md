# Welcome to Squigglies 

## What is this?

Squigglies is a little program that simulates [differential line growth](https://inconvergent.net/generative/differential-line/). It is built using JavaScript and the P5.js library.

## Differential Line Growth
 Putting it simply, differential line growth is an algorithm able to replicate some growth patterns an shapes observed in simple organisms such as molds or lichens and, more importantly, it's cool to look at!
